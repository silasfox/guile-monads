#+TITLE: README for Monads

guile-monads is a monads library for guile scheme.


** Installation:
   With guix:
#+begin_src shell
  guix package -f guix.scm
#+end_src

** Usage:

#+begin_src scheme
  (use-modules (monads))

  (with-m m-seq
	  i <- '(1 2 3)
	  j <- '(2 4 6)
	  (return (list i j)))

  ; => ((1 2) (1 4) (1 6) (2 2) (2 4) (2 6) (3 2) (3 4) (3 6))
#+end_src

#+begin_src scheme
  (use-modules (monads))

  (reify m-seq (list (reflect-seq '(1 2 3))
                     (reflect-seq '(2 4 6))))

  ; => ((1 2) (1 4) (1 6) (2 2) (2 4) (2 6) (3 2) (3 4) (3 6))  
#+end_src

Implemented monads are: Identity (m-id), Sequence/List (m-seq), State (m-state),
Maybe (m-maybe), Continuation (m-cont) and Writer (m-writer).
